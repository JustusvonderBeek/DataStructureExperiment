# Experimental Data Structure and Algorithm Repo
This repository is meant to hold important data structures and code samples for algorithms that might be interesting or relevant. It should also refresh my Java memories.

## Currently Implemented Data Structures
- SortedList
- Heap (min)

## Experiments
The difference in time between

| Operation | Algorithm 1 | Algorithm 2 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Insert | SortedList | UnsortedList |
| Insert | SortedList | Heap |
| Max | SortedList | Heap |
